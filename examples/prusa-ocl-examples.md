# OCL Good Practice Examples

The following examples use [Prusa](https://www.prusa3d.com) products to demonstrate how the OCL license applies in various real-world scenarios.

---

### Scenario 1: Hobbyist modifying and sharing designs

**Background**

Anna, a hobbyist using her printer purely for personal projects, downloads the OCL design files for a fan shroud. She skillfully modifies the shroud design in CAD, making it quieter and improving airflow. It's clearly derived from the original OCL design. Proud of her work, Anna uploads her modified design files (e.g., the STL or STEP file) to a popular sharing site like Printables or Thingiverse. She uses the CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license for her design.

**License application**

Anna uses her right to modify the OCL design and fulfills her obligation by using non-commercial, share-alike license for her derived design.

### Scenario 2: Using OCL tools for production

**Background**

Thomas is a business owner, having a small company producing headphones. He uses a 3D printer to print the headphone shells, and a OCL soldering iron-like tool to insert threaded inserts into the plastic to create his product to be sold.

**License application**

Thomas uses his right to commercially employ the OCL tool to create his own product.

### Scenario 3: Modifying OCL designs for internal use

**Background**

EfficientRepair is a commercial business specializing in electronics repair using among other things a Prusa toolhead to weld broken plastic. EfficientRepair downloads a OCL design files for a Prusa toolhead and modifies it to speed up its repair process.

**License application**

EfficientRepair uses its right to modify OCL design for its own internal commercial use.

---

### Scenario 4: Selling modified OCL designs

**Background**

CustomTools is a commercial business and downloads OCL design files for a Prusa toolhead. CustomTools modifies the OCL design to create a new "custom" toolhead (e.g., for a niche application). CustomTools then manufactures and sells this new, modified toolhead commercially.

**License application**

CustomTools is not allowed to modify the OCL design to be sold and should apply for business license.

### Scenario 5: Repair service selling printed parts

**Background**

FixItFast is a commercial business that offers paid 3D printer repair services to the public. Customers bring their broken OCL Prusa printers to FixItFast. To perform repairs, FixItFast downloads the official OCL design files for necessary replacement parts (e.g., a specific bracket, a plastic extruder part). They 3D print these parts using the OCL designs. They then install these self-printed parts onto their customers' machines and charge the customers for the repair service, which includes the cost of the part and labor. FixItFast does not have a separate business license.

**License application**

FixItFast is not allowed to copy OCL design to be sold and should apply for business license.

---

### Scenario 6: Right to repair

**Background**

George is a business owner who bought a stack of 3D printers to produce his products to be sold. His printers are fully utilized and sometimes require replacement parts. George downloads a OCL design files to create such replacement parts which he installs on his printers.

**License application**

George uses his right to repair with the use of OCL design.

### Scenario 7: Reselling community designs

**Background**

UpToDatePrint is a commercial business selling Prusa 3D printers to its customers. To have a business edge they want to copy custom community files derived from OCL designs as update parts to be sold alongside the printers. UpToDatePrint wants to keep its obligations under OCL and applies for business license.

**License application**

UpToDatePrint correctly applies for business license; however, UpToDatePrint should also contact the creator of derived design for commercial license.

### Scenario 8: Creator working independently

**Background**

Stephen is a talented creator who likes to transform the design of Prusa 3D printers. He does not use any OCL designs for his creations and works on the printers independently. His creations do not include any OCL components; and therefore, he publishes his creations on sharing site under CC-BY 4.0 license.

**License application**

Stephen‘s creations that are not derived from OCL designs do not fall under OCL obligations and can be used and shared without the need for non-commercial and share-alike license.
